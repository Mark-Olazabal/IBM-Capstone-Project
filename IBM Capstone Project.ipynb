    "<p>Many businesses have been closed for multiple months and in dire need of revenue. They would benefit from a new way to draw customers to their business as customers look to return to a sense of normalcy and routine. By leveraging Foursquare venue data and Seattle Public Art data, I would like to investigate the proximity of related or behaviorally relevant businesses and public artwork in the Seattle area to look for partnership opportunities. One business could offer a discount with a receipt at the next business.</p>\n",
    "<p><b>Target Audience:</b></p>\n",
    "<p>Small businesses located near public art installations. This could help businesses eager to re-open after shelter-in-place by creating a story/theme for those customers looking to get out of the house. Small businesses would care about this because it could offer a creative way to market to new/existing customers.</p>\n",
    "<p>Examples could be: a Coffee Shop to Pet Grooming to Pet Store, or Brunch Cafe to Museum to Grocery/Market discount.</p>"
